# MovieRoulette 

First dive into implementation of a Full Stack App.

Movie roulette pulls random movies off imdb.com then presents to user. On the React frontend, User uses buttons to make internal api calls allowing the Flask based backend. The frontend contains a series of ways to manipulate the backend through internal calling and is reflected by the state which the user sees.

This project not only showcased my skills in full-stack development but also demonstrated my commitment to delivering practical, scalable fullstack solutions.
